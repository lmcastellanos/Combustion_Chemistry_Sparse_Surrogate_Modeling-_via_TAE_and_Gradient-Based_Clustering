In this folder, it is possible to find some of the results for the clustering strategy K=2, while using all the carriers as inputs,
and evaluating in interpolation conditions.

The jupyter noteobok "GRI-mech_paper_reconstructec_species_T.ipynb" builds the graphs shown on the paper; with some indexing changes,
it is possible to reconstruct the cases for different ignition cases in interpolation conditions. 

In the same way, the notebook "GRI-mech_paper_reconstructec_species-MAE_histogram.ipynb" builds teh Mean Absolute Error histogram for
different iginition cases, which can be selected with indexing selection. 

The notebook "GRI-mech_paper_reconstructec_species-max-error_histogram.ipynb" instead, builds the Maximum Error Histogram for the same
ignition cases, which are selected throught indexing selection. 

Finally, the notebook "GRI-mech_paper_reconstructec_species-R2_histogram.ipynb" builds the R2 scores histogram, and also uses indexing
for selecting different ignition cases.

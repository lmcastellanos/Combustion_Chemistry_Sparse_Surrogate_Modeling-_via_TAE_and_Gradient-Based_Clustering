The regressions with all the carriers considered in the publication, are the cases with K=2 and K=4 clustering strategies.
Therefore, a folder for each case is observed. The nomclature is "Clusters_K". In each folder, it is possible to find some
.py files, one for each cluster number, starting from 0 to K, with the nomenclature "IDT_clusterK.py". Additionally, each 
cluster has its own results folder, named "cluster_K". Inside these folders, it is possible to find the resulting regression
coefficients, intercepts, and the R2 scores in the training data in .csv files. For the clusters which behavior has been 
described on the paper, further explanations are available inside their respective results folder.

In this folder, the datasets information should be allocated. The data is available in the link: 

https://zenodo.org/records/16893266

A Zip file is downloaded. Once it is decompressed,you can find all the data from the ignition trajectories 
analyzed in the publication. The files maximum_values_T1418.csv holds the valuesused for the magnitude normalization. 
The "Reaction_rates_cte_pressure_T1418_ste-quarter_phi_j.csv" has the reaction rates values for the j-th ignition
trajectory, while the files "State_space_cte_pressure_T1418_st-quarter_phi_j.csv" has the respective mass fractions. 

The folder "interpolation" holds the ignition trajectories used for the analysis in interpolation conditions 
across different clustering strategies (\phi=0.9, 1.0,1.1), while the folder "interpolation-K-4" has the 
ignition cases for the analysis of cluster_3 in the clustering strategy K=4. 

The folder "extrapolation_case" has the ignition trajectory used for the extrapolation analysis of the cluster_0, 
for the clustering strategy K=2, while
using all the carriers as inputs.  

The folder "interpolation_extremes" contains the ignition trajecotries \phi=0.5 and \phi=1.8, which are representative of the models performance in other clusters/chemical kinetics regimes.

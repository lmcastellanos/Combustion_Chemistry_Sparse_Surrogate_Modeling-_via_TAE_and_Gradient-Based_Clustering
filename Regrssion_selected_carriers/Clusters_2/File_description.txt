In this folder, you can find the codes used for implementing the respective regressions using selected carriers, for the clustering strategy K=2. The files "IDT_clusterK.py" contain the respective regressions and k-fold algorithms for each cluster.

The folders named "cluster_K" contain the respective results for each cluster, including the resulting coefficients, intercepts, and training
datasets R2 scores, each of them in .csv files. Inside these folders, you can find further 'File_descritipon.txt' files in case it is part of
the results shown on the paper.
